Due Date: 03/22/2019 23:59:59

In this assignment you will build the back end for the web application that you designed in assignment 1. 
Remember, we are only building back end in this assignment.

Description: 
A partner of your company has requested to build a web application that will predict the
rate of the fuel based on the following criteria:
- Client Location
- Competitors rate
- Client rate history
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)
- Seasonal rate fluctuation (%)

Back end must include following components/modules:
- Login module
- Client Profile Management module
- Fuel Quote module, includes list of quote history for a client.
- Pricing module. Only create a placeholder. You will implement this in last assignment.

Important deliverables:
- You should have validations in place for required fields, field types, and field lengths. 
- All backend code should be covered by unit tests. Code coverage should be grater than 80%. 
- Research how to run the code coverage reports. Each IDE has plugins to generate reports. Here are few pointers. https://stackify.com/code-coverage-tools/
- All front end should be connected to back end. Form data should be polulated from backend. Backend should receive data from front end, validate, and prepare to persist to DB.
- WE ARE NOT IMPLEMENTING DB yet. Only create the wireframes for it.

Deliverables:
NOTE: Only provide a word / pdf doc. Do not commit your code to SVN. University SVN has limitations on what type of file you can upload. You can use GIT for your group collaboration and code.

1.	Only provide screenshots of your code? (50)

2.	Discuss if your design and development methodolgy has changed since assignment 1 and assignment 2 and why? (10)

3.	Provide code coverage report? (40)

What to turn in: 
- Only soft copy uploaded to SVN before due date. 
- No extensions.
